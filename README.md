# Texture shading

> Texture shading is a new technique for generating shaded relief images to show the three-dimensional structure of mountainous terrain. It differs from traditional hillshading and can be used either as an alternative shading method, or as an enhancement to hillshading by combining the two methods. Texture shading emphasizes the drainage network (canyons and ridges) of the landscape and exhibits a visual hierarchy that reflects this structure. It can be used to bring out fine details that are present in high-quality elevation data, and likewise as a tool to examine digital elevation models for unwanted data artifacts.
